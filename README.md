This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K per year based on demographic and employment-related attributes. The dataset used is the Adult Income Dataset, also known as the "Census Income Dataset." It contains various features such as age, workclass, education level, marital status, and more, offering a comprehensive view of factors that may influence income levels.
The primary goal is to preprocess the data to ensure quality and consistency, then apply and compare the performance of six machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree,Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifie and Random Forest Classifier. Model evaluation will include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the most effective approach.
